| March 5  | 10:55am - 11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              During this class the problem set was introduced and we began to discuss various solutions to the edit distance idea. Most of which seemed to have exponential time and required a lot of calculations. However, towards the end we realized their may have been a better (dynamic programming) appraoch to the edit distance method. |
| March 7  |  8:50am - 9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                      During this session we got up onto the boards and drew out some examples for the edit distance. One idea I had to increase the efficiency of the code was to do a prefix search of maybe 3 layers down or something which would allow us to terminate word generation paths well before the time complexity increases heavily of those. Additionally, there may have been a way to relate edit distance and LCS which Landon described to us. |
| March 11 |  1:45pm - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Discussed the tabulation approach to edit distance with an example and handout and found a relation between subproblems that would make this problem more efficient. Me, Tony, and Landon talked about how to specifically implement this algorithm in our problem to make it as efficient as possible. |
| March 13 | 12:35pm - 1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Spent the entire class today coding the edit distance method, tested it and fixed minor out of bounds errors with a main function. It works on the three simple test cases I gave it. |
| March 15 |  7:15pm - 8:15pm  | For this work log I tried to implement the n-grams but got lost in issues such as what if our word is only 3 letters long or lower, etc. So I'm skipping the ngram implementation for now and am just assuming I generate them correctly. I am trying to code the actual piece that uses the narrowed down list of candidate words to return words within an edit distance of 4. I coded something to do with grabbing words from an arraylist of arraylists but it got confusing to use an arraylist as a map so I took a step back, reduced my modulus, and am now using an array of arraylists. |

| March 17 | 10:45am - 11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                             I finished my code within the first 10 mins of class then for the remainder of class me and tony made tiny alterations to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our results from changing our codes behavior when given words smaller than the n gram size, etc. I also worked with tony to fix an infinite loop in his code. As of the end of this class my code works well but there is still room for improvement. |
| March 19 |  8:45am - 9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Completely changed my hash generation code based off a recommendation by Tony to use my previous ngram hash to calculate my next one (increasing the efficiency of my code heavily). I also modified the fill ngrams and recommend functions to incorporate this new code and it works well once more. |

Now all I have left is to write the readme, etc. |
