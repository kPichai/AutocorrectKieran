| March 5  | 10:55am - 11:55am |                                                                                                         During this class the problem set was introduced and we began to discuss various solutions to the edit distance idea. Most of which seemed to have exponential time and required a lot of calculations. However, towards the end we realized their may have been a better (dynamic programming) appraoch to the edit distance method. |
| March 7  |  8:50am - 9:55am  | During this session we got up onto the boards and drew out some examples for the edit distance. One idea I had to increase the efficiency of the code was to do a prefix search of maybe 3 layers down or something which would allow us to terminate word generation paths well before the time complexity increases heavily of those. Additionally, there may have been a way to relate edit distance and LCS which Landon described to us. |
| March 11 |  1:45pm - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                       Discussed the tabulation approach to edit distance with an example and handout and found a relation between subproblems that would make this problem more efficient. Me, Tony, and Landon talked about how to specifically implement this algorithm in our problem to make it as efficient as possible. |
| March 13 | 12:35pm - 1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Spent the entire class today coding the edit distance method, tested it and fixed minor out of bounds errors with a main function. It works on the three simple test cases I gave it. |
